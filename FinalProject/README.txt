This project acts as a database for movies. When you click on Add Movie, it takes you to a form where you
can enter a movies data: Title, Runtime, A rating in stars, and your own review of the movie.
This data is then added to a mongodb collection

When clicking movie info, there is a form where you enter a title, and it will give you the info previously entered
about this title. If there is no such movie title, it will output none as the results.

When clicking on select by runtime, you can input the maximum amount of hours you want your movie to be. It will then display
a table of all the movies and their runtimes that are strictly less than the number you input.

Finally, when clicking on remove all movies, it will clear the entire collection of everything that has been added.
